Load data and variables:
	-loaded signal
	-wavelet family name used									7
	-t1, t2: the range of time that is used to process ( in second)					12 and 14
Norm and mix:
	-ecg and eeg2 or 1 and 3 because it's in colum 1 and 3 in the MIT-BIH dataset 			19 and 20
	-mixed ratio is a = 0.1585 									37
Wavelet deconstruction
	-level of detail is chosen at 5									75
	-donoho value for each level									177 to 181
Result contain 9 figure
