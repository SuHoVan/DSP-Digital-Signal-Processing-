*** Note for MEASUREMENT!!!

Main file: "test_real_data.m"

- Load data: 
  + data_filtered.csv file (include EEG1, EEG2 from measurement at ICT LAB). 


- Apply ICA 1st to 2 measured signals --> EEG^ & ECG^.
  + function (ICA.m -> acsobiro.m).
	*Note: func remove_dt --> Remove detrend ECG signal.

- Apply Wavelet Denoising technique to remove noise on EEG^ signal. --> Output: EEG^_Denoise. (eeg_wavelet).

  + function (preprocess.m).

- Successive Interference Cancellation process (SIC process).
  + diff1 & diff2 are subtracted signals.

- Apply ICA 2nd time: Include 3 inputs (diff1, diff2 & ECG^ from ICA 1st).
  + function (same with ICA 1st).
     --> Output: ECG~ = ecg_ICA2 (principle component), output2 & output3 (2 outputs are noise).

- Apply Wavelet Denoising 2nd time: --> Output: ECG~_Denoise = ecg_wavelet2.
  + func (preprocess1.m).

*Comparision:
 + Correlation: func (corr). 
 + Pan-Tomkins: func (pan_tompkin).
